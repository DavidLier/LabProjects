**BiopacSync**

Runs on both computers, links the two computers via a network socket, and allows communication between the two via UDP signals. Scripts in the **Experiment Builder** folder are in their corresponding paradigms and allow for requesting events at certain times, and sending signals to the data collecting computer to place markers in the software (Biopac). 
.bats just run the BiopacSync with the right configuration for each computer.

**StimuliSender**

Stimuli Sender is a project I use for forcing the transmission of signals for testings sake.
