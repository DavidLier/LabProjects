### Repo Containing Projects

A few of the projects that I've worked on in the lab.


**Mindfulness Project**

EEG, ECG, Respiratory Data Analysis

**ECG Analyzer**

Real time ECG Analysis Tool - Links to other Devices

**System Sync Tools**

General Tools and Scripts for Syncing across Devices

**Concussion Project**

Machine Learning Data Analysis, and other Analysis

**Face Array Project**

Image Analysis for discerning if ERP responses were image based, and other things related to the project

**Familiarity Game**

Prototype card flipping memory game, placeholder face images, works with experiment builder to ensure stimuli from the game correspond with stimuli presented in the paradigm. 

**Baroreceptor-Cardiac Project**

Nothing really unique here, just miscellaneous related to the project (Reaction times, accuracies, figures)

**fNIRS Paradigm**

Before I had access/learned Experiment Builder, needed a paradigm for a small preliminary project, so I coded it.
