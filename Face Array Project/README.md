Contains some of the miscellaneous things I worked on for our face array project, but it doesn't have the ERP data analysis since that wasn't entirely mine, I only made edits to modify that portion of the project and I felt like it would be misleading to include code I had only edited.

**Image Analysis**

Script for generating different image related metrics that previous research has shown to modulate ERPs, these metrics were then considered when analyzing the ERPs to see if it had some affect and to ensure that our widely  varying stimulus images weren't the real reason we saw effects.


**Etc.**

Other scripts were other minor things, like one of the figures seen in the manuscript, and verification of the reaction times and accuracies to ensure people were focused on the task and that the timing of responses didn't bleed into ERPs.
