**fNIRS Paradigm**

Old project before I learned Experiment Builder, essentially an experiment where images were shown at different intervals since we had just gotten our fNIRS device up and running and I was tasked with doing the preliminary setup for the data analysis pipeline so we wanted to get our hands on some data. Lost the analysis code, but one of the figures is in the extras directory.
