**ConcussionML**

Analysis of our concussion metrics using StartifiedKFold. I had a python version of this that was slow (partially because of the device but also because of scikit learn / python) so I remade it in Java because it's what I'm most comfortable with.

**Etc.**

Other scripts were for generating figures (Seen in Figures) and generating additional metrics for evaluating participants as a whole.
